\section{ENGINEERING PROJECTS}

\textbf{Cloud Portfolio Platform} \textbar\ AWS (S3, CloudFront), HTML, CSS, JavaScript \hfill January 2026
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deployed my portfolio site using S3 for hosting and CloudFront for delivery, and tested it across browsers/devices to make sure pages load consistently and the layout stays clean.
    \item Kept the S3 bucket private and served content through CloudFront using Origin Access Control and a bucket policy, double-checking that direct S3 access is blocked the way it should be.
    \item Set up HTTPS behavior, basic caching rules, and billing alerts (Budgets), then fixed issues like 403 errors and cache problems by adjusting policies and distribution settings until it stayed stable.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Secure File Management System} \textbar\ Java, MySQL \hfill November 2025
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built a Java backend where multiple users can manage files, using role-based access so permissions are clear for reading, uploading, editing, and deleting.
    \item Added authentication and authorization checks around sensitive actions and designed MySQL tables for users, roles, and file metadata so the data stays structured and easy to maintain.
    \item Improved reliability with input validation and transaction-based updates to reduce data issues during concurrent actions and repeated operations.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{GmailBillTracker} \textbar\ Python, Gmail API \hfill August 2025
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built an automation script in Python that scans and processes 100+ emails through the Gmail API to pull out billing-related messages like invoices, receipts, and confirmations.
    \item Implemented OAuth 2.0 and filtering using common senders and keywords to reduce noise and keep results focused on finance-related emails.
    \item Exported structured output for easier review and handled edge cases like forwarded threads, inconsistent formatting, and duplicate emails across long reply chains.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hand Gesture Recognition System} \textbar\ Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe \hfill July 2025
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built a real-time hand tracking pipeline using OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks from a live camera feed during continuous use.
    \item Used landmark movement to recognize a set of gestures and mapped them to basic actions as a touchless control demo with simple feedback.
    \item Tuned thresholds and frame processing to reduce false triggers and keep it responsive across different lighting, camera angles, and normal room distance.
\end{itemize}
